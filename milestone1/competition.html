        <h2>Competition Analysis</h2>

        <h4>What are competitors doing right?</h4>
        <p>Our competitors often have strong marketing campaigns, organized event schedules, and attractive sponsorship
            deals that help bring attention to their raceways.</p>

        <h4>What are competitors doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>Many competitors fail to engage with local communities and fans outside of events. Their websites are often
            outdated and difficult to navigate, with limited information on schedules and ticketing.</p>

        <h4>How can we do it better?</h4>
        <p>Red Rock Raceway will provide a modern, easy-to-use website with clear schedules, streamlined ticket
            purchases, and interactive features for fans. We will also focus on building a strong community both online
            and at the track, ensuring racers and spectators feel connected year-round.</p>
